# Projects

## Automated Waste Segregation using Computer Vision <a href="https://github.com/Zzabi/Waste_Detection_YOLOv5"> <img src="images/external_link.png" alt="GitHub" width="20" height="20"></a>

- Developed an advanced waste segregation system using YOLOv5 for accurate identification and classification of various waste materials, enhancing recycling efficiency and environmental sustainability.
- This project aims to detect and classify 7 classes of waste which include paper , plastic , metal , cardboard , glass , thermocol and wet-waste. The model has been trained on datasets which are a combination of already available datasets from roboflow and images collected and manually annotated using LabelImg which consisted a total of around 7000 images. The model achieves an accuracy of 85% after 50 epochs.


## Food Ordering App <a href="https://github.com/Zzabi/Snackzy"> <img src="images/external_link.png" alt="GitHub" width="20" height="20"></a>

- Developed a canteen app utilizing Firebase Authentication and Real-time Database, enabling seamless food ordering, real-time updates, and secure payments for users
- Snackzy is a food ordering app designed for canteens. It supports real-time ordering and includes features for authentication, payment, and admin management. Admins can add or delete new items from the menu, and users can authenticate and make payments seamlessly.

## Recipe Cookbook <a href="https://github.com/Zzabi/RecipeCookbook"> <img src="images/external_link.png" alt="GitHub" width="20" height="20"></a>
- Created an application to store and display recipes, allowing users to add and filter recipes by meal type and dietary preference.
- Used MySQL as the database and Tkinter for front end.

## Facial Emotion Detection <a href="https://github.com/Zzabi/Facial-emotion-Detection"> <img src="images/external_link.png" alt="GitHub" width="20" height="20"></a>
- Developed a Facial Emotion Recognition system using neural networks and deep learning techniques to train the model on a comprehensive dataset to accurately identify emotions from facial expressions
- Developed a deep learning model that classifies facial emotions into seven categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.
-  The model has been trained on the FER-2013 dataset and achieves an accuracy of 90% after 30 epochs.
